Draw support from the Kirlia line ensures consistency.\n\nStrategy: The primary goal is to establish Team Rocket's Watchtower in play. Once active, Slaking ex's ability (which normally prevents it from attacking if the opponent has no Pok\u00e9mon ex or V in play) is nullified because Slaking ex is a Colorless Pok\u00e9mon. This enables Slaking ex to use its powerful \"Great Swing\" attack consistently. Early game focuses on benching Slakoth and Ralts, using Squawkabilly ex for initial draw. Evolve Ralts into Kirlia for its \"Refinement\" ability, and then into Gallade to search for Supporters. Arven helps find Rare Candy, Tools, or Energy. The deck aims to maintain stadium control with multiple copies of Team Rocket's Watchtower.\n\nCard Synergies:\n- Slaking ex + Team Rocket's Watchtower: The core combo. Watchtower blanks Slaking ex's detrimental ability, allowing it to attack freely.\n- Kirlia (Refinement) + Gallade (Buddy Catch): Kirlia provides consistent draw, while Gallade fetches Supporters.\n- Arven + Rare Candy/Tools/Energy: Arven provides access to essential components for setting up Slaking ex quickly.\n- Squawkabilly ex / Lumineon V + Forest Seal Stone: These Pok\u00e9mon provide powerful one-time abilities and can utilize Forest Seal Stone for a VSTAR Power search.\n- Double Turbo Energy + Slaking ex: Allows Slaking ex to attack for one energy attachment (doing 230 damage), speeding up its offensive presence.\n- Psychic Energy + Kirlia (Refinement): Psychic Energy serves as discard fodder for Kirlia's ability and can be used by Gallade if necessary."]]
